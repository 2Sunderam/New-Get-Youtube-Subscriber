# New-Get-Youtube-Subscriber

# The pourpose of the project is to get the Name of the Subscriber and the Channel that is subscribed and this is done by using a api for fetching data from the backend. The server is created and data is stored in MongoDB database. Get request are send to the backend and data is fetched and rendered in the frontend.

npm install --save-dev jest # Install as a development dependency

7. **Swagger (Optional)**: We use Swagger for API documentation. You can install the Swagger UI package using npm: npm install swagger-ui-express

# Frontend
The Frontend of the application can be run using the npm run start command in the command prompt, also various dependencies and installations have to be installed like React Router Dom.
npm install
**Axios**: We use Axios for making HTTP requests in the frontend. It's already included in the frontend dependencies.
**React Router DOM**: For routing within the React app, we use React Router DOM. It's also included in the frontend dependencies.
Then start the project using npm run start 
Make sure that node and npm is also installed for react run on the device.

# Usage-
The app could be used for data rendering and the scaled up version of the same could be developed as an account data storage and analysis tool.The user data is stored in mongoDB Database and the data could be retirived using api.The different api endpoints can be used for this pourpose.In the live server the data could be rerived in following:
Names of subscribers
https://subscribers-oyrz.onrender.com/subscribers
Name and Subscribed Channel
https://subscribers-oyrz.onrender.com/subscribers/names
Single subscriber detail with id as the name of subscriber
Example:https://subscribers-oyrz.onrender.com/subscribers/John Doe
The frontend can be easily seen by either running it on local machine with react.It is also hoisted in https://64e22d5ce0168070ef5748ce--glistening-pithivier-9d332f.netlify.app/. 

# Features
The main feature of the application is that data could be accesed from the backend which is very scalable.The basic data retriving can be scaled up for making very good analsis website. All the api endpoints are properly validated and tested.
